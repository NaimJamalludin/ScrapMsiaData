# Scrap Malaysia Data

This project is intended to scrap list of data from [Malaysia's Open Data](http://www.data.gov.my/data/en_US/dataset) into a markdown table for easy-viewing.

However, I have not yet completed the project due to time constraints. 

Maybe one day, I will try my best to complete it.

In the mean time, you are free to download and modify the application as you wish.
